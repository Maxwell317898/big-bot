# big-bot
a discord bot for use on repit (again i recomend replit as it is the only thing i have tested)
you could run this on your pc but i use macos and just use replit for its conviniance

# help
how do i use this?
set the values for your discord bot token in replit secrets name it what it is in the code
do this for openAI api key if you want this feture to work (it is always fun to mess arond with error handeling)
for the ai feture the error messages must be sent to a channal in 1 server for your develop related stuff
fill in the server ID (you will not have to keep this a secret*) and then a channal ID
you then run the code in replit (other optons can be used but are not supported by me)
at start you will see a 5 line-ish long error this is fine just ignore it

* *server & channal IDs dont have to be a secret because server IDs are only used for identifying servers (your bot has to be on the server that corasponds with the ID)
  also to invite the bot to the server goto your application>bot>permissions then just do administrator now goto >Oauth2>url generator you will see scopes select the bot
  scope you are almost done just select admin for permisions then use that link add it to your development server and test it out
